Do you like dogs? How about cats? During the day, this app will display a random image of a cat,
and at night a random image of a cat. Each image stays up for five minutes and the time of sunrise
and sunset is determined by the geolocation of the user's device.

This app was written using:
- 100% Kotlin!
- LiveData and ViewModel lifecycle components
- Coroutines for asynchronous networking calls
- Dagger Hilt for dependency injection
- Glide for image display
- GSON for JSON deserialization
- OkHttp for networking
- JodaTime for time and date models
